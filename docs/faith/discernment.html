  <h2>Discerning God's Will for Your Life</h2>
  <h3>Step 1: Get yourself into a state of grace</h3>
  <p>I consider my discernment to have begun in college. I had fallen away from the Church for a while. I was like an onion: my innermost desire (whether I knew it or not) was for God. My inner life, however, was not into my faith and did not trust God. My outer life still <em>looked</em>  like a Catholic; I still went to church and even confession (?!), but in reality I was steeped in sin.</p>
  <p>The first rule of the discernment of spirits (which, of course, I had no idea about at the time) indicates that when a person is in a habitual state of sin, the Holy Spirit convicts and nags. And He sure did for me. I kept feeling restless. I didn't trust the LORD and His glorious promises, so I pursued and settled for pleasure and happiness instead of joy and fulfillment.</p>
  <p>I have since found it impossible to discern God's Will for your life when you are separated from Him by grave sin.</p>
  <p>Step 1: If you are not in a state of grace, get there ASAP.</p>
  <h3>Step 2: Trust the LORD</h3>
  <p>I soon found out that my restlessness meant I needed major change in my life. I tried to trust God and broke up with a long-time girlfriend. That lasted all of two months, at which point I promptly got back together with her because I didn't actually trust God.</p>
  <p>Here's the thing about trusting in God, though: God <em>is* love. As such, He is not capable of wanting anything except the best for us. Remember: love is *willing the good of the other as other*. In other words, because God is love, He wills our good. Put another way: *God's will for your life is your good</em>.</p>
  <p>Step 2: You gotta trust God.</p>
  <h3>Step 3: Consider counsel from people who know you well</h3>
  <p>I knew that my way wasn't working, so I tried to throw myself at God. I toted with the ideas of NET (National Evangelization Team) and the seminary. My friends who knew me best were suspicious that neither was right for me. I sought their counsel, but didn't actually listen to them.</p>
  <p>Step 3: Ask people who know you well for advice. But then actually <em>consider</em> it.</p>
  <h3>Step 4: Novenas aren't authentic discernment</h3>
  <p>I ignored my close friends and dared God to stop me as I tried to discern Him.</p>
  <p>I interviewed for NET. They invited me to serve, but I (somehow) realized that it wasn't God's will for my life, so I turned them down.</p>
  <p>I set my eyes on something bigger: seminary. I met with the Vocations Director several times, and got halfway through the application. At the time, I was finishing a devotion to Mary. I felt uneasy about the seminary (which I attributed just to nerves), so I prayed a half-hearted novena of rosaries for Mary to help guide me. Another close friend reminded me that novenas aren't a subsitute for really sitting and reflecting on God's will. I, of course, didn't listen.</p>
  <p>Step 4: Pray novenas, but don't let them be your only method of discernment.</p>
  <h3>Step 5: Double-down on trusting God and do something rather than nothing</h3>
  <p>God humors the ignorant. On the eighth day of my novena, my now-wife walked into my life. She captivated me with beauty (remember, God lives in the true, the good, and the beautiful!). Thinking that I was going to be a priest, she approached me with hard questions about the faith (she was on the verge of becoming Catholic). I finally took a serious look at my faith. I learned truth. I also found joy again instead of restlessness. In my experience, God acts through joy (note well: not <em>pleasure* or *happiness*, but *joy</em>).</p>
  <p>So I ghosted the vocations director (sorry, Father!), took a step and dated her. I dared God to stop me if that was His will (are you sensing a theme here?), but He never did.</p>
  <p>There's a famous math problem called the Monty Hall problem, a game show in which you choose between three doors (one of which has a car and the other two of which have goats). Monty, who knows what's behind each door, then shows you a goat. He then offers you the opportunity to switch doors or stay with your original choice. With Bayesian statistics, you can prove that it's advantageous to switch doors.</p>
  <p>What does this have to do with discernment? Being a statistician, I would say that it means you'll make better decisions with more information. So trust in God and take a step. He won't let you down.</p>
