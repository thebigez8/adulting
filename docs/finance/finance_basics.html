  <h2>The Basics of Personal Finance</h2>
  <p>Finance isn't complicated (but it may be <em>difficult</em>). Here's the basic outline:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Don't buy anything you can't afford. Don't buy a house if you can't afford it. Scrutinize all purchases. (This is what makes this <em>difficult</em>, even if it's <em>simple</em>.)</li>
    <li>Save $1000 as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li>Get insurance. Probably choose a <a href="medical_plans_2020.html">high-deductible health plan</a>.</li>
    <li>Your employer probably offers a match on contributions to a 401(k)/403(b). Contribute to these funds up until you maximize this match (it's free money). Buy only low-cost index funds and hold them forever.</li>
    <li>Pay off all debts except your house. Pay off credit cards monthly.</li>
    <li>Save 6 months of living expenses (how much money you'd need if you lost your job for 6 months) and don't touch it.</li>
    <li>Save for retirement by contributing to tax-advantaged accounts. Decide if a <a href="roth_vs_trad.html">traditional or Roth account is for you</a>.</li>
    <li>Pay off your house early.</li>
  </ol>
