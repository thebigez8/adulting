  <h2>Which Grocery Store is Cheapest?</h2>
  <p>I like saving money, which led me to a natural question: how can I save money on groceries? To answer this question, I selected 27 common items and 5 stores, and over the span of 3 days visited each store to record the price (and size) of each item. Where possible, I tried to find comparable items across the stores (which ended up being harder than I thought). Some items I simply couldn't find (Where does Hy-Vee keep its olive oil? Why was Target out of chicken strips? Can I petition Aldi to carry Annie's Mac and Cheese?). Where more than one choice existed for a certain item, I'd usually pick the cheapest (which almost always ended up being the store's own brand). This is an important qualification of this analysis: the prices here aren't necessarily for the highest quality item.</p>
  <p>Using R, I normalized the data to calculate a price per unit (thanks to Costco for selling things in far more enormous quantities than I need). I then calculated the price per item per month (since if I only have to buy an expensive item once per year at a store but everything else is cheap, I'll still want to go there). This is the second important qualification of this analysis: I had to estimate how many times per month we bought each item. Turns out we (I) eat a lot of Annie's mac and cheese and chicken strips. I guarantee that no one else has the same grocery purchase profile as the one I settled on.</p>
  <p>The results shook out like this:</p>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebigez8/grocery/master/price_per_month.png" class="overlay-toggler" data-target="price-per-month-plot" alt="Plot of Price per Month per Item at Each Store"/>
  <div class="overlay hidden" id="price-per-month-plot">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebigez8/grocery/master/price_per_month.png" alt="Larger Plot"/>
  </div>
  <p>I ran a linear model to predict the (natural log of) price per month per item based on store and item (taking advantage of the factorial design). The full results are <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebigez8/grocery/master/results.md">here</a>, but I'll summarize them here:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Aldi is the cheapest</li>
    <li>Costco is on average 1.19 times more expensive per month per item than Aldi (p = 0.041)</li>
    <li>Target is on average 1.2 times more expensive per month per item than Aldi (p = 0.006)</li>
    <li>Walmart is on average 1.29 times more expensive per month per item than Aldi (p &lt; 0.001)</li>
    <li>Hy-Vee is on average 1.29 times more expensive per month per item than Aldi (p &lt; 0.001)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To be fair, Target is helped by the fact that I have the Target app and a RedCard, which means all items are essentially already 5% off for me. At all the other stores, I took into account my 2% cash back on my normal credit card.</p>
  <p>To make sure these results weren't driven by a single item, I ran a sensitivity analysis, removing each item in turn and recalculating the model. In all models, Aldi remained the cheapest. Costco traded spots with Target in 4/27 models, and Walmart traded spots with Hy-Vee in 5/27 models.</p>
  <p>So what did we learn?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Aldi is cheap. Yikes.</li>
    <li>Costco might live up to its reputation (but is the membership cost-effective? That's a question for another day...).</li>
    <li>For all food that Aldi doesn't sell (or for emergency grocery runs), we'll go to Target, which is the closest to our home anyway.</li>
    <li>Walmart and Hy-Vee are just too expensive.</li>
  </ol>
