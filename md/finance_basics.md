## The Basics of Personal Finance

Finance isn't complicated (but it may be *difficult*). Here's the basic outline:

1. Don't buy anything you can't afford. Don't buy a house if you can't afford it.
  Scrutinize all purchases. (This is what makes this *difficult*, even if it's *simple*.)

1. Save $1000 as quickly as possible.

1. Get insurance. Probably choose a [high-deductible health plan](medical_plans_2020.html).

1. Your employer probably offers a match on contributions to a 401(k)/403(b). Contribute to these funds up until you
  maximize this match (it's free money). Buy only low-cost index funds and hold them forever.

1. Pay off all debts except your house. Pay off credit cards monthly.
  
1. Save 6 months of living expenses (how much money you'd need if you lost your job for 6 months) and don't touch it.

1. Save for retirement by contributing to tax-advantaged accounts. Decide if a
  [traditional or Roth account is for you](roth_vs_trad.html).
  
1. Pay off your house early.

These steps are a consensus of information from these sources:
