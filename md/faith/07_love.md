## What is Love?

<blockquote cite="http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/22">
  <p>"Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?"</p>
  <p>He said to him, "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart,
     with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment.
     The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

### Love defined

Love is the ultimate good. Not freedom, not choice, but love.

We take St. Thomas Aquinas's defnition of love: to <dfn>love</dfn> is to will the good of the
other (as other). That is, to love is to want *what is good* for another person, and 
*not for your gain but for theirs*.

### What love isn't

This definition is critical, because along with it come several important points:

1. Love is not wanting what's *easy* for another person.

2. Love is not *blindly accepting* another person.

3. Love is not (simply) *feelings* toward another person. Certainly feelings have their
   place in love, but on their own are not sufficient to be love.

4. Love is not *tolerating* another person.

5. Love is not passive; it requires willingness to act. To *will* the good of the other.

6. Love is not selfish. It is not *use*. It does not seek one's own good, but rather the
   good of another person *as other*.

### Love as a relationship

Love is a relationship: a person willing the good of the other. Love, therefore, involves a lover,
the beloved, and the love between them. This is precisely why God, who is love itself,
*must be a trinity*: God the Father loves Jesus the Son, and the love between them is the Holy Spirit:

<blockquote cite="http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/3">
  <p>After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were opened
     [for him], and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove [and] coming upon him.</p>
  <p>And a voice came from the heavens, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</p>
