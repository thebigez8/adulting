## Introduction

This series of posts will attempt to walk readers through the Catholic faith from beginning to middle (trust me,
there's far too much to claim we'll take you to the end). We begin with a discussion of truth and who God is,
followed by an examination of the most revealing of God's qualities: love. From here we will deduce much of
Catholicism's social teachings in a logical, straightforward way.
